To build and run from Terminal:

1. Create a folder called "build" at the root project directory. This is necessary because Git does not support adding empty folders to source control.
2. Navigate to the ~/build folder. (optionally clean this folder with "rm -rf *")
3. run "cmake .."
4. run "make"
5. run the generated program in the ~/build/bin directory.
